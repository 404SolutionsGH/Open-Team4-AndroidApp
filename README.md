In Ghana and neighboring countries, tro tro are privately owned minibus share taxis that travel fixed routes leaving when filled to capacity. While there are tro tro stations, these vehicles for hire can also be boarded anywhere along the route.

# The Idea

## The Problem

1. No Data - passengers cannot search relevant data (fares, routes, missing items) on
taxi and trotro on the internet
2. Hailing is done by hand - There's no platform to connect taxi, trotro drivers to
passengers. No GPS coordinating between driver and passenger
3. No data on trotro/taxi reduce quality of service.
4. Passengers wait for long in queue
5. No incencitive/ accountability for drivers and conduct/passengers

## Solutions

1. A trusted, fast, and convenient on-demand
minibus service.
2. Schedule dispatch to reduce long queues.
3. A KoosePi device that uses GPS to track
passengers and drivers.
4. A simple web and mobile app for fare queries.
5. Optimize fleet and incentivize drivers and
conductors.
6. Refactor the industry via local government
and other trotro agencies.
